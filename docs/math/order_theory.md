Dilwoths's theorem: Suppose that the length of the longest antichain in the poset P is r, then P can be partitioned into r chains.

Dilworth's dual theorem: Suppose that the length of the longest chain in the poset P is r , then P can be partitioned into r antichains.

Erdős-Szekeres theorem: Given n ≥ rs + 1 , any sequence of n elements has either an increasing subsequence of length r+1 or a decreasing subsequence of lengthe s+1.
